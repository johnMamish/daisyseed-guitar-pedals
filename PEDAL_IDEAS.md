# Pedal ideas

## Transcription pedal
Looper pedal specifically tailored to use as a utility for looping short snippets of audio when trying to transcribe a song or solo.

Left footswitch: while this is held down, a section of the input is stored for looping. Press the footswitch where you want the loop to start and release it where you want the loop to stop.
Right footswitch (or maybe toggle switch): pause / play.

Knob 1: Start position trim. This lets you trim into the start position of the loop.
Knob 2: Stop position trim. This lets you trim into the stop position of the loop.
Knob 3: Padding. This lets you add silence in between loops
Knob 4: Speed. Slows down or speeds up the audio.
TBD: a built-in filter might be nice - if you're trying to transcribe bass, might be nice to have a way to filter out highs.

## Autowah / envelope filter
Might be interesting to try and add fundamental frequency tracking to figure out what range to sweep the wah over.

Also might be interesting to have the envelope generated from an attack detector PLUS a true envelope detector.

Knob 1: Q-factor tuning.
Knob 2: envelope sensitivity.
Knobs TBD: attack detector params.
Knobs/switches TBD: filter frequency level.

## Chorus / Octaver / Harmony pedal
Make a chorus pedal. One specifically for saxophones.
Unlike traditional chorus pedals, I'd like to try and make one that's 'aware' of how saxophones sound.
