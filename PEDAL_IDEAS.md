# Pedal ideas

## Transcription pedal
Looper pedal specifically tailored to use as a utility for looping short snippets of audio when trying to transcribe a song or solo.

## Autowah / envelope filter

## Chorus / Octaver / Harmony pedal
Make a chorus pedal. One specifically for saxophones.
Unlike traditional chorus pedals, I'd like to try and make one that's 'aware' of how saxophones sound.
